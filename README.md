#### Learning Objectives:
* Using HTML tags to structure a webpage (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`).
* Applying basic CSS rules for colors, backgrounds, and typography.
* Implementing **Flexbox** for a columnar and row-based layout.
* Making a webpage **responsive** with the viewport meta tag and CSS media queries.
