# ALX HTML/CSS: My First Portfolio

---

## Project Description

This repository contains my first web portfolio, a project developed as part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development** program. The goal of this project is to apply foundational skills in HTML and and CSS to build a static website.

The project is structured into several tasks, each focusing on different core concepts:
* **HTML Structure**: Building the basic layout with elements like `header`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`.
* **CSS Styling**: Applying styles to enhance the visual appeal of the website.
* **CSS Flexbox**: Implementing a responsive layout using Flexbox to control the positioning of elements.
* **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website is usable and visually consistent across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
